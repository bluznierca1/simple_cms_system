# simple_cms_system
Simple CMS system with user and Admin area. It is not responsive. It is not about the design, it is about PhP functionality. 

Website with panel for typical users and admins.
To become and admin, you have to be in database. To get added - another admin has to add a new admin.
Users can only see info about subjects and pages - admin can change everything - edit/remove/add new.

This is written to learn how to work with PhP - based on lynda.com tutorial.

Works only on MY localhost - there is a database that is needed to this.
